The App component maintains a selectedGood in its state, with "Jam" as the default.
It displays the selected good's name in an h1 element, with a "ClearButton" when a good is selected.
The has-background-success-light class is applied to the tr of the selected good.
Each good has an "AddButton" to select it, with only one good selectable at a time.
The "RemoveButton" is displayed for the selected good to clear the selection.
When no good is selected, the title shows "No goods selected."
